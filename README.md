This package contaings several vignettes that each present an untidy dataset and show how to make it tidy:

1. "Cost of publishing in journals"
2. "Gross Domestic Product"
3. "Hypoxia"
4. "Preparing multiple event data for analysis"
5. "Untidy Spreadsheet"

The vignettes are written by different authors, and present an interesting set of examples in different writing and coding styles.
