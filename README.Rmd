# untidydata2

The goal of untidydata2 is to provide a collection of untidy data, and show how to make it tidy.

## Installation


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(untidydata2)
## basic example code
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.
